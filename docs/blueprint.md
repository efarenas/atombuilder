# **App Name**: Atom Builder

## Core Features:

- Particle Manipulation: Drag and drop atomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons) onto a canvas.
- Element Display: Dynamically displays the formed chemical element symbol as the user adds particles.
- Atomic Number Calculation: Automatically calculates and shows the atomic number based on the proton count.
- Mass Number Calculation: Automatically calculates and displays the mass number (protons + neutrons).
- Electron Shell Display: Displays electron configuration of each elements to show how they populate each shell.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#74A3E5) to evoke science and stability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F9) to reduce distraction and provide contrast.
- Accent color: Pale green (#90EE90) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, provides a modern, neutral appearance suitable for clear data representation.
- Use clear, minimalist icons for the draggable particles (protons, neutrons, electrons).
- The particle workspace will fill most of the screen and allow dragging and dropping particles freely.
- Gentle transitions when particles are added or when information is updated, such as the atomic number or mass number, to give the interface a smooth, responsive feel.
